# Mastodot - Mastodon on a Dot Matrix Printer

This is being made as an installation for [Electromagnetic Field Festival](https://emfcamp.org)

## Usage

You'll need to install the dependencies first:

```bash
npm install
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run start
```

The running program buffers incoming toots and prints them out on the dot matrix printer.
